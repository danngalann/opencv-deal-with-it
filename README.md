This is script is based on a project from [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/05/creating-gifs-with-opencv/) adding support for real time face tracking from either a video or a camera stream, saving the result to a file.

A demo of this script can be found [here](https://youtu.be/OYN9kkdiiw4).
